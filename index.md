# An experience that could change my life!

## **Hello all**, I am Nicolo' Pasian and I come from Venice, Italy!
I am a Marine Biologist, I studied at University of Bologna for my Bachelor Degree, at University of Padua for my Master Degree and I did my internship program as Assistant Researcher at Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia where I studied the social behaviour and interactions in reef manta ray!
