# AN EXPERIENCE TO CHANGE MY LIFE!

## **Hello all**, I am Nicolo' Pasian and I come from Venice, Italy!
I am a Marine Biologist, I studied at University of Bologna for my Bachelor Degree, at University of Padua for my Master Degree and I did my internship program as Assistant Researcher at Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia where I studied the social behaviour and interactions in reef manta ray!



## **Is time to improve my skills!**
Now, after I graduated in November 2020, I choose to improve myself, in fact I will do the course of Web and Mobile App Development at Cornerstone to be more competitive in the future! One of my first thing is to complete a PhD in Marine Science! Crossing fingers!
